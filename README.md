# AnvilASM

**A high-level library for reading, modifying, and generating JVM bytecode.**

AnvilASM is a modern successor to SharpASM, designed to make JVM bytecode manipulation intuitive and developer-friendly within the .NET ecosystem.

## 💡 Design Philosophy

Unlike traditional stream-based parsers (such as the Visitor pattern often found in Java libraries), AnvilASM is built around a **High-Level Object Model**. The library abstracts the complexities of the raw binary format into a structured, easily navigable hierarchy.

The workflow is straightforward:

1.  **Parse**: Converts raw JVM bytecode (`.class` files) into a rich high-level data structure.
2.  **Modify**: Access and edit class elements (constants, methods, fields, instructions) directly, using standard C# collections like Dictionaries and Arrays.
3.  **Build**: Reconstructs valid JVM bytecode from the modified structure, handling serialization details automatically.

## ⚠️ Important Note

This project is currently under active development and reconstruction. 

If you attempt to run the generated bytecode on a JVM during this phase, you may need to disable the bytecode verifier (e.g., using `-Xverify:none` or `-noverify`) as the output may not yet fully comply with strict JVM verification constraints. **It is not recommended for production use at this stage.**
